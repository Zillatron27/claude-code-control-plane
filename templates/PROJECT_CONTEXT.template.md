# [Project Name] — Project Context

## What Is This?

<!-- One paragraph: what does this project do, who is it for, what problem does it solve.
     An executor starting a fresh session should understand the project's purpose from this alone. -->

## Environment

<!-- How to run, build, test, and deploy this project.
     Include actual commands, paths, and any environment-specific setup.
     If it runs in a container, note that. If it needs specific tooling, list it. -->

### Running Locally
```bash
# Commands to start the development server / run the app
```

### Testing
```bash
# Commands to run the test suite
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Commands or steps to deploy to production
```

### Repository
- Repo: <!-- git URL -->
- Branch strategy: <!-- main only, feature branches, etc. -->

## Tech Stack

<!-- Frameworks, languages, key dependencies.
     Not every package — just the ones that define how the project is built. -->

## Project Structure

```
project-root/
├── src/
│   └── ...
├── tests/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

<!-- Annotate directories and key files with their purpose.
     This is the map an executor uses to navigate the codebase. -->

## Current State

**Version:** <!-- current version -->
**Last Updated:** <!-- date of last context file update -->

<!-- What phase is the project in? What's been completed recently?
     What's actively being worked on? This section changes frequently. -->

## Known Issues

<!-- Tracked bugs, limitations, or technical debt.
     Remove entries when resolved — this is current state, not history. -->

## Planned Work

<!-- What's coming next. Ordered by priority if possible.
     Remove entries when completed and update Current State instead. -->

## Key Decisions

<!-- Architectural or design decisions that affect how the executor should work.
     Why things are built the way they are, especially when it's non-obvious.
     An executor that doesn't understand these will try to "fix" things that aren't broken. -->
